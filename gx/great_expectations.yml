stores:
# Stores are configurable places to store things like Expectations, Validations
# Data Docs, and more. These are for advanced users only - most users can simply
# leave this section alone.
#
# Three stores are required: expectations, validations, and
# evaluation_parameters, and must exist with a valid store entry. Additional
# stores can be configured for uses such as data_docs, etc.
